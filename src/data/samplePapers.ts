    title: "Husserl's Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness and Its Implications for Moral Decision-Making",
    category: "Philosophy",
    abstract: "This paper explores Edmund Husserl's analysis of internal time consciousness and its fundamental role in shaping moral decision-making. It argues that moral deliberation is not an abstract, atemporal process but is deeply embedded in the temporal structure of consciousness, specifically through the interrelation of retention (immediate past awareness), primal impression (awareness of the present), and protention (anticipation of the future). The study applies Husserl's insights to challenge traditional moral frameworks that treat ethical reasoning as a purely rational exercise, instead demonstrating that moral decisions arise from the continuous modification of consciousness over time. By integrating phenomenological insights with contemporary research in cognitive science and ethics, the paper provides a more comprehensive understanding of how temporality shapes responsibility, agency, and ethical deliberation.",

    title: "Hierarchical Self-Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning: Capturing Multi-Scale Structural Information",
    category: "Machine Learning",
    abstract: "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in learning representations from graph-structured data. However, their reliance on large amounts of labeled data limits their applicability in scenarios where labeled information is scarce. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical self-supervised graph contrastive learning framework that effectively leverages unlabeled data to enhance node representations. Our method captures structural information at multiple levels—node, subgraph, and graph—through a hierarchical contrastive learning objective. By employing an adaptive graph augmentation strategy, we ensure that the generated views preserve essential structural properties while maintaining diversity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including Cora, Citeseer, PubMed, and Reddit, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both supervised and self-supervised baseline models in node classification tasks, particularly in low-label regimes. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the contributions of each hierarchical component and provide qualitative analyses illustrating the discriminative power of the learned embeddings. Our findings highlight the potential of hierarchical contrastive learning for improving generalization in graph representation learning, with broad implications for applications in social networks, biological networks, and recommendation systems.",

    title: "Grammaticalization of Evidentiality in Amazonian Languages: The Cultural Imperatives of Knowledge Management and Information Reliability",
    category: "Linguistics",
    abstract: "This paper investigates the grammaticalization of evidential markers in Amazonian indigenous languages and their deep connection to cultural imperatives surrounding knowledge management and information reliability. Evidentiality, the grammatical encoding of information sources, plays a crucial role in Amazonian societies, where oral traditions and the necessity of accurate information transmission shape linguistic structures. Unlike Indo-European languages, which often use lexical means to express evidentiality (e.g., 'apparently' or 'I heard that'), Amazonian languages integrate evidential distinctions as obligatory grammatical categories. This study explores how these evidential markers emerge through grammaticalization pathways—such as perception verbs evolving into evidential morphemes—and how they reflect broader epistemological concerns. Through case studies of several Amazonian languages, we analyze the role of evidentials in reinforcing social norms, particularly in discouraging misinformation and maintaining speaker credibility. Additionally, the paper examines how evidentiality interacts with other grammatical categories, such as tense and aspect, and how its obligatory nature contributes to the stability of these linguistic systems. The findings suggest that evidentiality is not merely a linguistic feature but a core aspect of cultural cognition and social organization, demonstrating the interplay between linguistic structure and cultural priorities.",

    title: "From Truman to DOGE: A Technological Revolution in Federal Downsizing",
    category: "Political Science",
    abstract: "This paper examines the historical evolution of government efficiency initiatives in the United States, culminating in the establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) during the second Trump administration. It explores how DOGE integrates Silicon Valley-style technological innovation and private-sector management principles into federal governance, marking a radical shift from previous government reduction efforts. By leveraging artificial Intelligent, data analytics, blockchain technology, and automation, DOGE aims to streamline bureaucratic processes, identify inefficiencies, and implement large-scale cost-saving measures. The paper contextualizes DOGE within past attempts at government downsizing, from Theodore Roosevelt's Keep Commission to Reagan’s Grace Commission and Clinton’s National Partnership for Reinventing Government. It also critically assesses the political and structural challenges of such efficiency efforts, including bureaucratic resistance, fiscal constraints, and ideological debates over government’s role. The study further analyzes the leadership dynamics behind DOGE, particularly the appointment of Elon Musk, and evaluates the broader implications of a tech-driven governance model in a complex political landscape.",

    title: "From Taoguang Yanghui to National Rejuvenation: China's Evolving Grand Strategy and the Rise of a Sinocentric Global Order",
    category: "Political Science",
    abstract: "This paper analyzes the trajectory of China's grand strategy from Deng Xiaoping's policy of 'hiding capabilities and biding time' (taoguang yanghui) to Xi Jinping’s vision of national rejuvenation, revealing a significant shift in China’s approach to global power dynamics. By examining key strategic transformations, including the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and military modernization, this study argues that China is systematically challenging the U.S.-led international order while working toward the establishment of a Sinocentric global system by 2049. The paper situates China’s strategic evolution within the historical context of the 'century of humiliation,' demonstrating how national memory continues to shape its global ambitions. Through an interdisciplinary analysis integrating international relations theory, strategic studies, and economic policy, the study provides a comprehensive assessment of China’s selective revisionism—accepting parts of the existing order while reshaping others. The research explores how China’s economic statecraft, technological advancements, and military expansion contribute to a broader vision of geopolitical reordering, offering insights into the implications for global stability, U.S.-China competition, and the future structure of the international system.",

    title: "Extending Stability Analysis to Adaptive Optimization Algorithms Using Loss Surface Geometry",
    category: "Machine Learning",
    abstract: "This paper explores the stability properties of adaptive optimization algorithms, such as Adam and RMSProp, by extending linear stability analysis to account for their interaction with the geometry of the loss surface. Despite their effectiveness in accelerating convergence, adaptive optimizers often generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a phenomenon attributed to their tendency to converge to sharper minima. We introduce a novel generalized coherence measure that quantifies the relationship between the adaptive preconditioner and the Hessian of the loss function, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability near stationary points. By analyzing how preconditioners affect optimizer dynamics, we derive practical guidelines for hyperparameter tuning that improve the generalization performance of adaptive optimizers. Extensive experiments on benchmark deep learning models, including ResNet and Vision Transformers, validate our theoretical predictions, demonstrating that aligning the adaptive preconditioner with the loss surface geometry through careful hyperparameter selection can reduce the generalization gap between adaptive methods and SGD.",

    title: "Dynamic Routing Mixture of Experts for Enhanced Multi-Label Image Classification",
    category: "Computer Vision",
    abstract: "Multi-label image classification (MLC) is a fundamental problem in computer vision that requires the simultaneous identification of multiple objects or attributes within an image. Existing approaches rely on shared backbones and static gating mechanisms, which often fail to effectively capture complex label correlations and handle label heterogeneity, leading to negative transfer effects. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Routing Mixture of Experts (DR-MoE) model, an advanced mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework that integrates input-dependent dynamic gating networks. Unlike static gating models such as Hybrid Sharing Query (HSQ), our approach allows dynamic selection and weighting of shared and task-specific experts based on input features, thereby improving adaptability and performance. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC 2007, demonstrating that DR-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance by outperforming baseline models such as HSQ, Q2L, and ML-GCN. Further ablation studies validate the advantages of dynamic gating in enhancing model flexibility, mitigating negative transfer, and improving per-label classification accuracy, particularly for labels with high heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that incorporating dynamic routing into MoE architectures presents a promising direction for advancing multi-label image classification models.",

    title: "Beyond National Security: The CIA's Covert Operations as Instruments of American Hegemony and the Strategic Costs of Blowback",
    category: "Political Science",
    abstract: "This paper critically examines the CIA’s covert operations, arguing that they have functioned not merely as reactive security measures but as proactive instruments for maintaining American hegemony. Through an extensive historical analysis, the study reveals how interventions during the Cold War and post-9/11 era were strategically designed to destabilize governments that pursued nationalist or socialist policies deemed threatening to U.S. interests. The research delves into case studies including the 1953 coup in Iran, the 1954 Guatemalan intervention, and the CIA’s role in Chile, Indonesia, and Nicaragua, illustrating a systematic approach to influencing foreign political landscapes. Additionally, the paper explores the phenomenon of 'blowback'—the unintended consequences of these operations—demonstrating how short-term tactical successes often led to long-term strategic failures, fostering regional instability and fueling anti-American sentiment. By integrating insights from Intelligent studies, international relations, and declassified documents, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the CIA’s operational philosophy, questioning whether its activities have ultimately strengthened or undermined U.S. national security and global standing.",
